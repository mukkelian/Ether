# Efficient Tool for THermodynamics Exploration via Relaxations (ETHER)


Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are powerful computational tools for investigating thermodynamic behavior and validating analytical approaches in complex physical systems. Here we present ETHER (Efficient Tool for THermodynamics Exploration via Relaxations), an open-source MC simulation package, developed for studying temperature-dependent magnetic properties in spin systems. ETHER enables large-scale MC simulations of various spin systems to analyze phase transitions, critical behavior, and complex magnetic structures. The package constructs spin-lattice networks from standard structural input files and supports exchange interaction definitions through user-specified neighbor lists. It also provides tools for easy visualization and post-processing of simulation outputs. Our code has been benchmarked thoroughly against results reported in the literature for common representative magnetic systems. This user-friendly code offers researchers a versatile platform for exploring thermodynamic properties of complex magnetic systems.
